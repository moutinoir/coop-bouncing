Online manual: http://docs.fluffyunderware.com/curvy

====================== GETTING STARTED =============================================
1.) Create a curve with GameObject (Hierarchy->Create->Curvy->Spline)
2.) Take any object (e.g. a simple cube), attach the FollowSpline script (select object, then -> Create->Curvy->Components->Follow Spline)
	and set it's spline property to the above spline
3.) Hit Run and enjoy!
4.) Read the docs and enjoy it even more!
